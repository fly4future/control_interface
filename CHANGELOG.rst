0.1.0 (2022-02-02)
-----------
* added an arming_ready state. Now, after the arm service is complete, takeoff can be called immediately
* the after-takeoff mission is now sent when transitioning from taking_off to autonomous_flight state
* manual takeoff during landing should no longer spam
* moved common functions to fog_lib, renamed yaw to heading for consistency
* refactorng mission-related stuff to MissionManager
* refactoring of mission-related stuff to a separate class MissionManager, WIP
* mission start retries added, no longer checking health mid-flight
* switch back from manual now checks the vehicle_state\_ instead of pixhawk's landed_state, minor refactoring
* add ID to navigation requests, send confirmation back in diagnostics
* nicer printing of waypoints
* fixed include folder export
* moved state enums to an include to allow easy including from navigation, minor fixes
* Merge branch 'matous' of github.com:fly4future/control_interface into matous
* added fog_lib dependency
* takeoff waypoint height is relative to averaged takeoff position, added a more detailed print if not healthy
* now publishes cmd_odom from pixhawk as PoseStamped, resetting mission progress counters, other minor stuff
* working version, refactoring, fixes
* updated the diagnostics message, started rewriting cmd_pose\_ to be more correct (but it's not working 100%)
* renamed desired_pose to cmd_pose for consistency
* fixed deadlock in landing
* improved reporting of current mission status, added some prints
* mission upload is only cancelled if a mission is being uploaded, other minor fixes
* removed pause_mission in stopMission that may be causing pixhawk to switch from manual
* added some prints in case mission cannot be stopped
* fixed a potential rare deadlock in mavsdk callback thread
* only callback durations over a certain threshold will be printed
* stopping mission before transitioning to the not_ready state to prevent buffering of missions in pixhawk that will be executed right after arming, which is dangerous
* fixed mission aborting, other minor QoL improvemetns
* added an extra check before taking off that the vehicle is not armed and printing of callback timings
* improved state update after takeoff to work also with instant takeoff, minor changes with takeoff/landing prints
* manual/automat fixes for real drone
* added throttle to an annoying output
* fixes in manual override after during takeoff
* now prints number of GPS samples received/required, changed GPS position buffer to circular_buffer
* mavsdk logging to file can be disabled by setting filename to empty
* throttled some output, added mavlink logging
* added more verbose output for failures, diags are published in separate thread, waiting for octomap reset, other minor fixes and updates
* minor fixes with mission cancelling and other little things
* Merge branch 'devel' into matous
* reverted -Og to -O3
* refactored to use vehicle states instead of a multitude of flags
* mission progress deadlock hotfix
* fixed callback group
* takeoff hotfix
* wip implementing vehicle state
* working. Mission state is now published. Changed some mutexes to recursive to avoid deadlocks because of how callbacks are called.
* fixed callback groups
* changed callback groups to multiple single-threaded ones
* refactoring waypoint callbacks
* wip cleanup and refactoring to squash bugs due to parallelization
* Update build scripts
* Update topic names for rebased PX4
* Add containerized build workflow
* Fix deps_ws directory in packaging script
* Update galactic support to github  workflows
* New build scripts with container build
* cherry-pick mavsdk init separation from branch galactic
* fixes of warnings found using ros2 galactic (`#17 <https://github.com/tiiuae/control_interface/issues/17>`_)
